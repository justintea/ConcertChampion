# Project 4: Condotierre 📊



## Requirements for Project 🏗
 - A working full-stack, single-page application hosted online.
 - Be a complete product, which means that it is usable from head-to-tail, in the environment it is meant for.
 - Have a well-styled interactive front-end. Note: front-end does not mean javascript in the browser. Front-end can also mean HTML and CSS.
 - Communicates with the Server backend via AJAX.
 - Implement at least 10 API endpoints across all CRUD functions, e.g. 1 endpoint for Create, 1 for Read and so on
 - Use at least 10 API endpoints across the front-end.
 - Use a database or a way to store your data, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
 - Have suitable validations for the database, client and server
 - Implement authentication. Including the ability of a user to sign-up, log in & log out with password hashing.
 - Implement authorisation by restricting CUD data functionality to authenticated users. Also, navigation should respond to the login status of the user.
 - Require at least 2 types of login, example user and admin, the different types should have difference accesses to the APIs and Webpages
 - Implement full CRUD the app has to be able to create, read, update and delete data from the database
 - Have a well-scoped feature-set. Full-CRUD data operations are not required if one or more other features are included, for example:

   - Implement additional functionality if the user is an admin.
   - Implementation of a highly dynamic UI or data visualisation.
   - Other, instructor approved, complexity/features.
